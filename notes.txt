	[x] Redo notebook custom-...-3 with topleft as the target
	[ ] Build an import script for setup
	
	[ ] tut_multitask_3 - bottom section is wrong, doesn't account for topleft task
		[ ] Net3 is built on 
		[ ] Part _04.ipynb also does center point instead of topleft
	
	[ ] Do a commit
	
	[ ] bring where/argmax to FeatsNet
	
	Interesting idea: the threshold of the cutoff could be differentiable
		Could this be done with a RELU?

		[ ] Redo notebook custom-...-3 with topleft as the target
		
		
		Thoughts
		[ ] One thing I'd like to see is adding dummy variables
			- either constants or random values
		[ ] Can I add argmax / argmin in later layers too?
		[ ] What exactly do the argmax features do?
			- why aren't the new features exact matches to the synthetic point targets?
				- could they be made so?
		[ ] Could this model be even better with more hidden layers?

Abandon gumbel softmax for now, work on trying to get argmax into the initial layer

	[x] new notebook
	[x] replicate exisiting work
	[x] look at iafoss's solution, how is his differentiable?
		-> it only changes dimensions of the tiles and puts it thorugh two separate networks
	[x] do we need the pprocessing layers in the init?
		-> to update the weights/biases-parameters, yes
		-> to do a forward pass, no

How to concat layers?

What does Unpool do?

Interesting to see how quickly you can converge in a bare bones mm-style NN task of predicting y from an arbitrary task. (from pytroch demo)

Maybe what we want is a custom nn.Module that does argmin / argmax as additional features when coming into the head.

	see:	https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_nn/two_layer_net_module.html#sphx-glr-beginner-examples-nn-two-layer-net-module-py

	
	Interesting challenge case: where the 3's look at topleft point and the 7's look at the middle point.
	
	Or extend this further, to all digits in mnist

	
 Combining digit classification and dependant point location as a task would have contributions to the OCR modelling space and even more broadly to the idea of understanding documents and diagrams.
 
	What are examples of OCR datasets?
	
	What are examples of OCR arch's?
	

Two strong claims I am making is that:
1. This task can't be done well with existing backbone + head. 
2. But I am saying some new form of either a head or full-bacbone-and-head does solve this problem well.

In regards to #1, what ways could I be wrong?

	One possibility is that image size is the problem and dimension redcution whem doing convolutional pooling is erasing the information.
	
	Maybe Min/Max Pooling would help my backbone preserve the information?
	
	Another option is is that I need to do lots of finetuning or feezing or re-training the backbone, or something?
	
	Could be some kind of batch/learning rate thing?
	
Embedding Argmax with autograd enabled:

	https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/differentiable-argmax/33020/8
	
	Could I do a set of AvgMinPool with succesive reduction
	https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/predict-a-categorical-variable-and-then-embed-it-one-hot/85555/5
	
	why is argmin differentiable? 	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54969646/how-does-pytorch-backprop-through-argmax
	
	"Siamese Network"
	
	"embeddings" in the network
	
	
We can check for if resnet has a "bad backbone" (loses information) or just needs a "better head" (in that the backbone is essentially worthless).

	We can flatten the img data initially and then compare that against the feature-map created by backbone...both fed into the same head...that will give us a relevant comparison.
	
What arch uses two pooling layers?
	-> Resnet18 does at the beginning of head: Avg + Max Pooling
	
	
	
Todo:
[x] replicate existing work
[x] add a torch.nn.Module to replicate the layers thing
[ ] do a forward pass on resnet18,
	[ ] examine traditional pooling
[ ] Replicate the argmax() with nn functions

"TopLeft" target is kind of an "arbitrary" point but should be close to what a bounding box is trying to predict. Why so poor?
    - note: that the point (min(cols), min(rows)) is the true topleft corner of the bounding box

Jeremy chops it up
https://www.wandb.com/podcast/jeremy-howard

My heads so far, like - Net3, Relu4, etc - all used flatten as the first step. That's a problem right there.
    maybe I can add on 

[ ] Get a RCNN pytorch model and watch how the head works?
