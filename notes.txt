"TopLeft" target is kind of an "arbitrary" point but should be close to what a bounding box is trying to predict. Why so poor?
    - note: that the point (min(cols), min(rows)) is the true topleft corner of the bounding box

My heads so far, like - Net3, Relu4, etc - all used flatten as the first step. That's a problem right there.
    maybe I can add on 

[ ] Get a RCNN pytorch model and watch how the head works?
